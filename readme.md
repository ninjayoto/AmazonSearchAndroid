 At some point I thought it would be interesting to make a 3rd party amazon app.  
 I quickly found out this is forbid in their terms of service so it didn't get very far.
 I cleaned up the code so maybe someone else can make use of it. 
 
The purpose of this app is to submit a query to the amazon product lookup API using web services,
 process the response and display the products in a gallery.  It should respond appropriately to all user input and 
 absence of network connection.  It targets android version 4.2 (jelly bean) with support for all devices
 running above 2.2(Froyo).  


 (1/26/2012) It turns out the GalleryView has been deprecated so that should be replaced at some point.
